Voltage dividers can be helpful in the instance where we have some fixed input voltage and want soem fixed output voltage. See if you can play around with the below circuit, change the input voltage from DC (Direct Current) to AC (Alternating Current) and see what happens."

    "> Okay, so that's cool, we saw how AC circuits are still reduced in voltage, similar to DC. But alternating currents have *another* property, the frequency! Notice how when you swapped over to alternating currents, it became all wavy and repeated itself over periods of time? Wouldn't it be cool we could *only* reduce the output voltage for certain thresholds of frequencies? \n",

    "> The most basic type of filter is the RC (Resistor-Capacitor) filter. These type of filters, depending on the structure of your circuit are able to either filter out values above a certain frequency or below a certain frequency. Now, the math is a bit complicated and it involves complex numbers and phasor analysis which will be covered more in depth in classes like EECS16B if you are interested, but just for the sake of an example, let's examine a low pass filter.\n",

And as w approaches infinity, then the bottom term approaches infinity and you get Vout = Vin. What this means is only low frequencies *pass* through the filter, or it's a *low-pass filter*.\n",
