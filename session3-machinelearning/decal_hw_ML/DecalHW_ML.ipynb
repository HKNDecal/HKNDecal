    "# **Homework 03: Machine Learning**\n",
    "## Going Down the EECS Stack Decal, Spring 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture, we talked about a variety of common machine learning methods, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they can be utilized to help us make sense of data. We specifically talked about two broad types of ML: supervised and unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we get started, in case you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, you can read more about them [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). At several points you'll be asked to run the code within a cell or write a response. To do so for both, just click anywhere in the cell, make your changes, and hit `shift` + `enter/return`. For this homework, you will not have to do any coding yourself, but you will have to answer some short questions. Anything labeled with \"Answer\" requires a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we'll be introducing another broad category of ML known as **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. RL is a training method that rewards desired actions and punishes undesired actions to achieve some goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is not too different from how a dog learns to do tricks. If Fido rolls over when told, he gets a treat and is more likely to roll over in the future. But if he decides to sit when told to roll over, he won't get a treat (negative reinforcement), and won't sit in the future when told to roll over. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, Fido is what's known as an **\"intelligent agent.\"** He's learning what actions to take (rolling over, sitting, etc.) based on a **reward function** (whether he gets a treat or not). More generally, the agent performs some action that makes a change to the environemnt to reveal a new state. A reward function is calculated based on this new state, and the agent considers both the reward and state that resulted from the previous action to decide if they should continue to perform that action or try something new. \n",
    "\n",
    "![rl_diagram](rl_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RL can essentially be broken down into 6 simple steps:**\n",
    "1. Observe the environment\n",
    "2. Decide how to act using some strategy\n",
    "3. Act accordingly\n",
    "4. Receive a reward or penalty\n",
    "5. Learn from the experiences and refine strategy\n",
    "6. Iterate until an optimal strategy is found\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is the type of machine learning that most closely mimics how humans learn, which offers some unique advantages. It's most commonly utilized in fields like robotics, natural language processing (NLP), and marketing. "

    "## **Q Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we'll specifically be discussing an algorithm known as Q learning. Q Learning is known as an *Off-Policy* algorithm, meaning it doesnn't follow some pre-determined policy, and instead starts off by taking random actions to eventually learn the best action to take in each state. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Fido uses his brain to store information about treats and rolling over, we will take a more minimalist approach and us a simple 2D array known as a **Q Table**. This table keeps track of how favorable an action-state combination is in terms of rewards. Each column corresponds to a different action, and each row corresponds to a different state of the environment. As you can imagine, that means Q Learning is best suited for situations in which the action and environment spaces are both discrete and small, so the Q Table doesn't grow too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, another form of RL known as Deep Q Learning operates by the same premise as Tabular Q Learning but replaces the table with a neural network to better deal with more complex actions and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the Q Learning agent begins by taking random actions so it can start populating the Q Table. This process is known as **exploration**, because it allows the algorithm to try out and learn about different actions. After a while, however, we want the agent to start **exploiting** the information we have in the table to make the best decision. But how do we know when to explore and when to exploit?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use what's called the **epsilon ($\\epsilon$) greedy model**. We start with an epsilon such that 0 <= $\\epsilon$ <= 1. We then generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the value is less than $\\epsilon$, we explore and choose a random action, but if the value is greater than $\\epsilon$, we exploit and pick the best possible action from the row in the Q Table corresponding to the current environment state (hence the term \"greedy\").

    "\n",
    "### **Q Values (Bellman Equation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual values stored in the Q Table aren't just the reward values, but they are dependent on them. The exact equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![bellman_eq.png](bellman_eq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't be expected to fully understand how the equation works in detail (feel free to look it up if you're interested), but the main things to notice are that the Q value at the given state action pair (S<sub>t</sub>, A<sub>t</sub>) is being updated by not just the reward (R<sub>t+1</sub>) associated with performing the action, but also the max Q value of the future state (S<sub>t+1</sub>) that would result from taking this action. In that sense, we're not just looking at how favorable the action would be in the current state, but in the future state as well. \n",

The passenger will randomly start each episode in one of 4 designated pickup/dropoff zones (represented by the colored squares), and the taxi will randomly start in one of those squares as well. A successful episode is one in which the taxi picks up the passenger and drops them off at their desired square, which is also randomly decided and represented by a building.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Env.step()**\n",
    "The step function is what actually applies the action to the environment, so in our case that's moving the taxi. It returns the new state, the reward, and whether or not the passenger was successfully dropped off (\"done\" variable). \n",

    "-1 for every step\n",
    "+20 for successfully delivering the passenger\n",
    "-10 for every incorrect or illegal pickup/dropoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other terminology...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Episode**: one run-through of the algorithm. In this case, it's one attempt of the taxi to successfully deliver the passenger. We end an episode once either the passenger is succssfully delivered, or we reach a threshold value for number of epochs in that episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epoch**: one step in the episode. Each epoch in this scenario corresponds to a move by the taxi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's visualize a runthrough of one episode where we are just randomly sampling actions to see what the taxi looks like in action. Note that although a reward function is being calculated, the agent is not learning from it in any way, which is why this taxi has no idea what it's doing.\n",
