    "Before we make a full neural net, let us look at something a bit simpler - logistic regression. You may have seen a logistic curve in calculus, and we can use it to classify binary data. Logistic regression will allow us to determine the probability of an input being a 0 or a 1. Observe in the graph above that the items towards the left of the curve are more likely to be 0 and the items towards the right of the curve are more likely to be a 1. So if we are given an input value X with an unknown class Y, we can predict its class based on where it lies on the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a logistic classifier on its own to predict which digit an image is. We will do this first - imagine that we create one logistic curve for each digit, and for a given input return the digit which has the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a logistic classifier is quite easy with scikit-learn. We will use the L-BFGS algorithm (limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm) as our logistic solver. Note that it might take a bit of time to train. You can read more about the algorithm here: http://aria42.com/blog/2014/12/understanding-lbfgs"

    "# Training a Neural Network\n",
    "Before we create our neural network, let us first look at how neural networks make predictions and how they are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Neurons\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, neural networks are composed of layers of \"neurons.\" Each neuron is responsible for its own little bit of computation. A neuron takes input from the layer before and combines them with some internal weights to generate a single output value. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of layer used in modern neural net architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fully Connected Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest neurons is called a fully connected (FC) layer, where the input is scaled and shifted to give the output. It is represented by the equation $y = Xw + b$, where where $X$ is the matrix input from past layers and $y$ is the matrix output. Here, the parameters are the weight matrix $w$ and the bias matrix $b$. Before this value is passed onwards to the next layer, however, it must be fed through a nonlinear activation function.\n",
    "We need a nonlinear activation function between every fully connected layer because having two FC layers one after the other is the same as having one FC layer. This is demonstrated in the calculation below. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: $y_1 = X_1w_1 + b_1$ and $y_2 = X_2w_2 + b_2$. With $y_1$ feeding into $y_2$, the final equation would be: $y_2 = (X_1w_1 + b_1)w_2 + b_2 = X_1(w_1w_2) + (b_1w_2 + b_2)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some nonlinear functions include RELU, sigmoid, tanh and maxout. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also get more freedom and control over how the predictions are made, which you can see an visualization for here: https://youtu.be/gmjzbpSVY1A?t=440\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A single neuron:\n",
    "<img src=\"files/neuron.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is fed through the layers of neurons in a feedforward neural network.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/neural_net.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The RELU activation function $f(x) = max(0, x)$: (note that it's basically just 2 line segments, but still quite powerful)\n",
    "<img src=\"files/relu.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs such as images are made up of millions of pixels, with each pixel having 3 values associated with it (R, G, and B). Feeding such a large matrix through an FC Layer would be very computationally expensive. Hence, a new type of layer called a Convolutional Layer was born. Convolutional Layers act as a \"sliding window\", multiplying different sections of the input matrix by the same, smaller weight matrix, called a **kernel**. Such computation is not only cheaper, but can also be paralllelized for maximum efficiency!\n",

    "## Loss and Backpropagation\n",
    "Our neural net will output digit probabilities for each image (a vector containing 10 probabilities). Although it predicts the digit with the highest probability, we still want to consider all the probabilities when training our neural network. For instance our image was a 7, a prediction of 40% for a 7 and 60% for a 9 is better than a prediction of 100% for a 2. We want a metric that will contain that information - not just whether or not we were correct, but how close we were.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we measure how well our neural network performs? We must define a loss function. The data loss then takes the form of an average over the data losses for every individual example. So, the loss is: (1/N) * (L_1 + ... + L_N). A common loss and the one we'll be using for our neural network today is cross-entropy loss:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_i = -\\log\\left(\\frac{e^{f_{y_i}}}{\\sum_j e^{f_j}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This loss is well-suited for prediction problems involving multiple classes (such as digits) and measures the distance between the predicted and actual distribution.\n",

    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "Once we have this loss, how can we use this error to improve our predictions? We want to minimize the loss (minimizing the error) and with neural networks we use a technique called backpropagation. Backpropagation is somewhat similar to gradient descent. In gradient descent, we look at the current slope of the graph and move down the slope towards the \"bottom\" of the hill. You can imagine that with enough iterations, we are able to find a \"valley\" in the graph which represents a minimum. In the graph below observe how the point moves downhill towards the blue valley.\n",
    "<img src=\"gradient_descent.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that the weights of our neurons are analogous to our coordinates on the graph, the loss as the height, and we look at the error to determine the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "With backpropagation, we are in essence doing this process for all the neurons in our network. However rather than simply using the final error / loss at the end for all neurons, we instead propagate that error backwards through the network, layer-by-layer. Thus each neuron has its own loss, based on the output it passed on to the layer after it. Backpropagation can thus be thought of as neurons communicating to each other (through the gradient signal) whether they want their outputs to increase or decrease (and how strongly), so as to minimize the total loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math behind backpropagation relies on the **chain rule** for partial derivatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Say $f(x, y, z)$ is our final output function value and that $f = (2x + 3y)z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we sort of have 2 layers:\n",
    "* The first is $q = x + y$\n",
    "* The second is $f = q * z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to see how $x$ affects the final value $f(x, y, z)$. We are given the final value $f(x, y, z)$ along with inputs x, y, z. We can calculate the value of df/dq directly through derivation: $\\frac{df}{dq} = z$. We also know the value of $\\frac{dq}{dx}$ is 2 (since $q = 2x + 3y$). Thus, we see that $\\frac{df}{dx} = 2z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of backpropagation, but the actual backpropagation for a neural network is essentially the same, just on a larger scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't taken multivariable calculus and don't know partial derivatives, this might not make the most sense, but don't worry the library will handle the details of backpropagation for you."
