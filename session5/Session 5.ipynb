    "4.  That folder in turn lives inside a folder named after whatever class the account you're using was issued for.\n",
    "5.  That folder in turn lives inside a folder named `cc`.\n",
    "6.  That folder in turn lives inside a folder named `home`.\n",
    "7.  The `home` folder lives inside the root folder `/`, which is at the top of the hierarchy.\n",
    "8.  The slashes in a folder's path (e.g. `/home/cc/cs199/fa13/class/cs199-abc`) indicate which folders you traverse in order to get from the root directory to that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ultimately, all data in files and folders is stored on hard drives (or SSDs). And hard drives are just spinning platters of magnetic fields. They don't know anything about hierarchies. Operating systems use _file systems_ to translate between the hierarchies you see and the bits on the hard drive. File systems are an abstraction: they let you divide and organize your data into files and folders without you having to worry about how that data is stored on disk."
