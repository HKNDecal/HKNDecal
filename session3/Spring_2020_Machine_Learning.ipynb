You can see the performance of difference machine learning algorithms here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ Note that some of the best algorithms can achieve an error rate of less than a percent. Many of those algorithms make use of neural networks, in particular convolutional neural nets (CNNs) which are especially well-suited to image classification.\n",

    "A neural network usually involves a large number of neurons operating in parallel and arranged in tiers. The first tier receives the raw input information - analogous to optic nerves in human visual processing. Each successive tier receives the output from the tier preceding it, rather than from the raw input. The last tier produces the output of the system. Each processing node has its own small sphere of knowledge, including what it has seen and any rules it was originally programmed with or developed for itself. In defining the rules and making determinations - that is, each node decides what to send on to the next tier based on its own inputs from the previous tier.\n",

    "Good data is the key to a good algorithm. To train a classifier, we need a dataset which tells us the correct output for a given input. Essentially, we need to provide it with examples of what we want it to do (this is called supervised learning). Fortunately for us, scikit-learn allows us to import datasets so we do not have to label thousands of images ourselves.\n",

    "When evaluating a machine learning algorithm it is important to split up the data into train and test sets. This will help us accurately evaluate the effectiveness of our predictions and help prevent overfitting. We use the training set to train our model and then use the test set to see how accurate our model's predictions are. If we trained on the entire dataset, it would be difficult to see how well our algorithm handles new input since we would be giving it data that it has seen before (and thus within our algorithm we have already kind of encoded the answer). The whole point is to make predictions about new data (we already know the answers to the given data) and it would be bad if our algorithm couldn't sufficiently generalize."

Observe in the graph above that the items towards the left of the curve are more likely to be 0 and the items towards the right of the curve are more likely to be a 1.

    "\n",
    "## The Neurons\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, neural networks are composed of layers of \"neurons.\" Each neuron is responsible for its own little bit of computation. A neuron takes input from the layer before and combines them with some internal weights to generate a single output value. Before this value is passed onwards to the next layer, it is fed through a nonlinear activation function. Which activation function to use has varied over the years and also depends on the specific implementation, but RELUs (rectified linear units) are quite common today. Some other activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, and maxout. These nonlinearities are part of what gives neural networks their power and distinguishes them from simple linear regression. With at least one intermediate hidden layer, a neural network is able to represent any continuous function. Hidden layers allow introduce more complexity into our predictor and allow us to classify even nonlinear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the inputs are simply combined as a linear combination with their respective weights (along with a bias term) to generate a value. This value is then passed through an activation function for the final output. The RELU activation function is f(x) = max(0, x). These outputs then form the input for the next neurons (depending on the type of layer, a neuron may use some or all of the outputs from the previous layer - we will be using fully connected layers so we will use all outputs from the previous layer). Calculating an output by passing an input through the layers of neurons (each responsible for their own computation) is called feed-forward computation.\n",

    "## Loss and Backpropagation\n",
    "Our neural net will output digit probabilities for each image (a vector containing 10 probabilities). Although it predicts the digit with the highest probability, we still want to consider all the probabilities when training our neural network. For instance our image was a 7, a prediction of 40% for a 7 and 60% for a 9 is better than a prediction of 100% for a 2. We want a metric that will contain that information - not just whether or not we were correct, but how close we were.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we measure how well our neural network performs? We must define a loss function. The data loss then takes the form of an average over the data losses for every individual example. So, the loss is: (1/N) * (L_1 + ... + L_N). A common loss and the one we'll be using for our neural network today is cross-entropy loss:\n",
    "<img src=\"files/cross_entropy.png\">\n",
    "This loss is well-suited for prediction problems involving multiple classes (such as digits) and measures the distance between the predicted and actual distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "Once we have this loss, how can we use this error to improve our predictions? We want to minimize the loss (minimizing the error) and with neural networks we use a technique called backpropagation. Backpropagation is somewhat similar to gradient descent. In gradient descent, we look at the current slope of the graph and move down the slope towards the \"bottom\" of the hill. You can imagine that with enough iterations, we are able to find a \"valley\" in the graph which represents a minimum. In the graph below observe how the point moves downhill towards the blue valley.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/gradient_descent.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that the weights of our neurons are analogous to our coordinates on the graph, the loss as the height, and we look at the error to determine the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "With backpropagation, we are in essence doing this process for all the neurons in our network. However rather than simply using the final error / loss at the end for all neurons, we instead propagate that error backwards through the network, layer-by-layer. Thus each neuron has its own loss, based on the output it passed on to the layer after it. Backpropagation can thus be thought of as neurons communicating to each other (through the gradient signal) whether they want their outputs to increase or decrease (and how strongly), so as to minimize the total loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math behind backpropagation relies on the chain rule for partial derivatives:\n",
    "<img src=\"files/chain_rule.png\">\n",
    "Say f(x, y, z) is our final output function value and that f = (2x + 3y)z. In this case we sort of have 2 layers - the first is q = x + y and the second is f = qz. Let's say we want to see how x affects the final value f(x, y, z). We are given the final value f(x, y, z) along with inputs x, y, z. We can calculate the value of df/dq directly through derivation: df/dq = z. We also know the value of dq/dx is 2 (since q = 2x + 3y). Thus, we see that df/dx = 2z.\n",

    "This is a simple example of backpropagation, but the actual backpropagation for a neural network is essentially the same, just on a larger scale.\n",
